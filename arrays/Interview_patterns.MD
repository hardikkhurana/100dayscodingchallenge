# IN INTERVIEW, LOOK OUT FOR PATTERNS  :
* Two pointer technique (generally after sorting)
* Hashing
* Bitsmasking (XOR TRICKS)
* Window sliding (MAX/MIN OF K SIZED WINDOW)
* Modified binary search (keep searching even if value is found by including other conditions)
* Prefix cumulative sum array (for range queries)
```
prefix[i] = arr[i] + prefix[i - 1]
```
