# TIPS FOR COMPUTING TIME COMPLEXITY :    
* Don't depend on just loops (either for or while),
* check actual loop variables whether they are incremented, decremened, multiplied, divided...
* For linked list, check how much pointer points to elements ?
* For stacks, queues, dequeus, how many elements are atmost procesed inside these ?
* For trees and graphs : how many atmost nodes are procesed ?
* For strings, arrays similar to linked list, how many times we are traversing to each one of
those elements, or how much our pointer points to ?
