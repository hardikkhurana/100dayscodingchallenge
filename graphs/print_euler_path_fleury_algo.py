# Program to print the euler path in the given graph.
# print the eulerian trail.
# STEPS : 
# * Make sure the graph has either 0 or 2 odd vertices.
# * If there are 0 odd vertices, start anywhere. If there are 2 odd vertices, start at one of them.
# * Follow edges one at a time. If you have a choice between a bridge and a non-bridge, always choose the non-bridge.
# * Stop when you run out of edges.
#
# This is called Fleury algorithm.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TIME : 0((E + V) * (E + V)) == O(E ^ 2)
# Time complexity can be improved to 
# 0(E)  in linear time using Hierholzerâ€™s algorithm.
# Below is optimized algorithm in linear time :
