# Given an undirected graph consisting of N vertices numbered [0, N-1] and E edges, the task is to count the number of cycles such that any
# subset of vertices of a cycle does not form another cycle.
# Since V vertices require V edges to form 1 cycle, these the number of required cycles can be expressed using the formula:  (Edges - Vertices) + 1
