# Given the number of vertices in a Cycle Graph. The task is to find the Degree and the number of Edges of the cycle graph.
# Degree: Degree of any vertex is defined as the number of edge Incident on it.
# Cycle Graph: In graph theory, a graph that consists of single cycle is called a cycle graph or circular graph.
# The cycle graph with n vertices is called Cn.
# It is a Connected Graph.
# A Cycle Graph or Circular Graph is a graph that consists of a single cycle.
# In a Cycle Graph number of vertices is equal to number of edges.
# A Cycle Graph is 2-edge colorable or 2-vertex colorable, if and only if it has an even number of vertices.
# A Cycle Graph is 3-edge colorable or 3-edge colorable, if and only if it has an odd number of vertices.
# In a Cycle Graph, Degree of each vertx in a graph is two.
# The degree of a Cycle graph is 2 times the number of vertices. As each edge is counted twice.
