# -100dayscodingchallenge

* Earlier it was only for motivation for getting started, now it has gone past 100 days and going for more and more problems.     
* Questions are almost all of taken from actual Interview problems and sources include but not limited to geeksforgeeks, leetcode, interviewbit.com, codeforces, codingBlocks etc..


### Good resource :

* [Note] : Solutions are not only code ! It contains complete detailed explanation as if I am explaining it in the interview with lots of I/O examples, intutions about different approaches and space-time tradeoffs discussions.

### For Hacktoberfest 2020 : 
> You are welcome to contribute to this repository for Hacktoberfest-2020 by submitting any interview related problems or competitive coding problems from various sites along with their solutions.
> Your file should include clear problem description, I/O i.e. input - output samples clearly, solution (all solutions if alternate approaches) and any follow up questions and its solutions.
> Explain your approach/intuition for the proposed algorithm before writing the solution (code) for the problem.
