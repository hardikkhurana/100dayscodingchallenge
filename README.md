# -100dayscodingchallenge

* Earlier it was only for motivation for getting started, now it has gone past 100 days and going for more and more problems.     
* Questions are almost all of taken from actual Interview problems and sources include but not limited to geeksforgeeks, leetcode, interviewbit.com, codeforces, codingBlocks etc..


### Good resource :

* [Note] : Solutions are not only code ! It contains complete detailed explanation as if I am explaining it in the interview with lots of I/O examples, intutions about different approaches and space-time tradeoffs discussions.

### For Hacktoberfest 2020 : 

> 1. You are welcome to contribute to this repository for Hacktoberfest-2020 by submitting any interview related problems or competitive coding problems from various sites along with their solutions.     
> 2. Your file should include clear problem description, I/O i.e. input - output samples clearly, solution (all solutions if alternate approaches) and any follow up questions and its solutions.      
> 3. Explain your approach/intuition for the proposed algorithm before writing the solution (code) for the problem.     
> 4. Please Don't duplicate the already solved problem.     
> 5. For complete beginners : you can try re-writing the code from Python to any different language of your choice (which you may have learned or learning) and submit your PR by creating a new directory inside the problem category as shown below :    
-- _root_ (100dayscodingchallenge)      
   -- _category1_ (ex. arrays)      
      -- new_dir named as "<programming_language_your_choice>_<problemName>" (ex. c++_rotateImage)         
         -- <solutionFileName_githubUsername>.language_extension (ex. rotate_image_xyz.cpp)      
  
> 6. For your queries or any confusion related to submitting your PR, please open a new issue and describe your query.
