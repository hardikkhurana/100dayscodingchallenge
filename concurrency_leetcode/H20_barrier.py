There are two kinds of threads, oxygen and hydrogen. Your goal is to group these threads to form water molecules. There is a barrier where each thread has to wait until a complete molecule can be formed. Hydrogen and oxygen threads will be given releaseHydrogen and releaseOxygen methods respectively, which will allow them to pass the barrier. These threads should pass the barrier in groups of three, and they must be able to immediately bond with each other to form a water molecule. You must guarantee that all the threads from one molecule bond before any other threads from the next molecule do.

In other words:

If an oxygen thread arrives at the barrier when no hydrogen threads are present, it has to wait for two hydrogen threads.
If a hydrogen thread arrives at the barrier when no other threads are present, it has to wait for an oxygen thread and another hydrogen thread.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a barrier is a type of synchronization method. A barrier for a group of threads or processes in the source code means any thread/process must stop at this point and cannot proceed until all other threads/processes reach this barrier.

class threading.Semaphore(value=1)
This class implements semaphore objects. A semaphore manages an atomic counter representing the number of release() calls minus the number of acquire() calls, plus an initial value. The acquire() method blocks if necessary until it can return without making the counter negative. If not given, value defaults to 1.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The solution creates 1 Semaphore for Hydrogen, and allows 2 threads to aquire it concurrently. Likewise, we create one for Oxygen, but this one only allows 1 thread.

To ensure the molecule is generated at once, we use a barrier, which can only be crossed when 3 atoms have gathered.

After each function completes, we release the token on the Semaphore.

from threading import Barrier, Semaphore
class H2O:
    def __init__(self):
        self.h = Semaphore(2)
        self.o = Semaphore(1)
        self.bar = Barrier(3)


    def hydrogen(self, releaseHydrogen: 'Callable[[], None]') -> None:

        # releaseHydrogen() outputs "H". Do not change or remove this line.
        with self.h:
            self.bar.wait()
            releaseHydrogen()


    def oxygen(self, releaseOxygen: 'Callable[[], None]') -> None:

        # releaseOxygen() outputs "O". Do not change or remove this line.
        with self.o:
            self.bar.wait()
            releaseOxygen()
