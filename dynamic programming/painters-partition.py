# We have to paint n boards of length {A1, A2â€¦An}. There are k painters available and # each takes 1 unit time to paint 1 unit of board. The problem is to find the minimum # time to get this job done under the constraints that any painter will only paint
# continuous sections of boards, say board {2, 3, 4} or only board {1} or nothing but # not board {2, 4, 5}.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Given an array A of non-negative integers and a positive integer k, we have to
# divide A into k of fewer partitions such that the maximum sum of the elements in a # partition, overall partitions is minimized.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A brute force solution is to consider all possible set of contiguous partitions and
# calculate the maximum sum partition in each case and return the minimum of all #
# these cases.
# That would take exponential time.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Now, we need to optimize using DP.
# Let's see optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.
#         T(4, 3)
#      /    /    \ ..
# T(1, 2)  T(2, 2) T(3, 2)
#           /..      /..
#       T(1, 1)    T(1, 1)
#
# T(n, k) = min(max(T(i, k - 1), sigma(A(j))))
# Base case : T(1, k) = A1
# T(n, 1) : sigma(A(i))

# Overalpping subproblems :

#   10 | 40 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50
#   10 | 40 | 20 30 | 40 | 50

# state of dp[painter][painting]
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# so, each state of dp[i][j] represents i painters, and j paintings (j elements of array )
# and we have to try all possible partitions and get the max for all the possible paritions.
# and then fill in the min of all those max calculated values.
# This will be the optimal value.

# TIME : 0(K * N^3), Now, if we preompute the cumulatove sum into a separate array and sum can be done in 0(1) time.
