# Program for counting unique BST's with 'n' number of nodes.
# From counting and observing as done for binary unlabelled trees, we can observe this follows catalan numbers,
# and we can directly return the value of catalan numbers.
# C : 1, 1, 2, 5, 14.....

# code will be similar to binary tree unlabelled counting.
# Also approach can be DP one or the binom formula.
