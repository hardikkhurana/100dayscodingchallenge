# Program to print the longest substring with exactly k unique characters , if more than one
# then print any one of them.
# "aabbcc", k = 1
# So, we can see what all ssubstrings we can generate :
# a, aa, aab, aabb, .....
# but the catch is to have a counter var for max len obtained so far and also if at anytime
# we found a substring with exactly k unique chars, so we can store it in a ans var.
# aa,
