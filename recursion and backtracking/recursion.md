# Recursive approach :
* Find out base case : which can be computed simply (to exit the recursion stack)
* Find out examples and relation between them , build up "leap of faith" recursion
* Finally, assuming leap of faith, write generalized equations for recursive calls.

### In this way, we can tackle most of the problems of recursion, assuming something that we have already implemented or it is avaiable to us, we just need to apply recursion whenever we can find problems to be broken down into smaller subproblems of same type.
