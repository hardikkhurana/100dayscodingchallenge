# program to generate wave type of sort known as wave sort, which satisfies following condition :
# arr[0] >= arr[1] <= arr[2] >= arr[3] <= arr[4] >= â€¦..
# IDEA: Logic is to fix all the even indices such that it gets bigger than its either adjacent elements (both sides) except first and last,
# the way to do is to traverse over the array and check if current even index element is smaller than previous one, then swap these both and
# similarly if it is smaller than its next element then, swap those, all other elements are taken care of.
# Time : 0(N), space: 0(1)

# function for sorting the array in wave form : B-S-B-S-B....
